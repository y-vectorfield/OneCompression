# vLLM Inference

OneComp-quantized models can be served with vLLM.
Each quantizer writes a `quant_method` field into the saved `config.json`; vLLM reads it
and dispatches to the matching plugin automatically — no extra configuration is needed.
Some methods are served by vLLM's **built-in** GPTQ plugin, while others use the
**OneComp** plugins that are registered via Python entry points when `onecomp` is installed.

## Supported Quantization Methods

| OneComp Quantizer | `quant_method` | Served by | Notes |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| `GPTQ` (uniform bit-width), `RTN` | `gptq` | vLLM built-in GPTQ plugin | Uses GPTQ tensor layout (`qweight`/`scales`/`qzeros`). Use `wbits` in {2, 3, 4, 8} for vLLM serving. |
| `JointQ` | `gptq` | vLLM built-in GPTQ plugin | Reuses GPTQ's tensor layout. Use `bits` in {2, 3, 4} for vLLM serving; `bits=1` is OneComp load-only with `pack_weights=False`. |
| `GPTQ` (mixed bit-width), `AutoBitQuantizer` | `mixed_gptq` | OneComp Mixed-GPTQ plugin | Per-layer mixed-bitwidth GPTQ. Automatically dispatches to Marlin or Exllama kernels based on bit-width and symmetry. `FusedMoE` layers are dispatched to vLLM's `MoeWNA16Config` GPTQ MoE kernel instead, using one GPTQ scheme aggregated across all experts in the layer (see [GPTQ MoE + vLLM](#gptq-moe--vllm)). |
| `DBF` | `dbf` | OneComp DBF plugin | 1-bit Double Binary Factorization. Uses GemLite kernels by default; set `ONECOMP_DBF_NAIVE_LINEAR=1` to use the naive fallback. |

!!! note "`Onebit` is not vLLM-servable"
    The `Onebit` quantizer saves with `quant_method="onebit"`, for which no vLLM plugin
    exists. OneBit-quantized models can still be loaded and run with OneComp's own
    [`load_quantized_model()`](examples.md#load-a-saved-quantized-model),
    but not served through vLLM.

!!! note "Rotation-preprocessed models"
    Models quantized after rotation preprocessing (`prepare_rotated_model`) are supported with the `mixed_gptq` and `dbf` plugins: the plugins reproduce the online Hadamard transform on `down_proj` inputs at inference time. The `dbf` plugin currently supports rotation only with `tensor_parallel_size=1`; `mixed_gptq` supports `tensor_parallel_size>1`.

!!! warning "GPTQ MoE models with activation reordering (`desc_act`/`actorder`) are not vLLM-servable"
    vLLM's GPTQ `FusedMoE` kernel (`MoeWNA16Method`) has no `g_idx` parameter, so a GPTQ
    MoE checkpoint quantized with `desc_act=True` carries activation-order information
    that cannot be served. `save_quantized_model(..., save_format="full_wrapper")` raises
    `RuntimeError` at export time rather than producing a checkpoint that fails to load in
    vLLM. Quantize MoE models with `desc_act=False` (the default) if you intend to serve
    them with vLLM.

## Installation

vLLM is available as an optional dependency:

=== "uv (recommended)"

    ```bash
    uv sync --extra cu130 --extra vllm
    ```

    !!! note "Use `cu130`; older CUDA extras are rejected"
        Recent vLLM releases depend on `torch>=2.10`, whose wheels are only published for the `cu130` PyTorch index. `pyproject.toml` therefore declares `--extra vllm` as conflicting with `cpu`, `mps`, `cu118`, `cu121`, `cu124`, `cu126`, and `cu128`; combining any of those with `--extra vllm` will fail at lock time. Use `--extra cu130` for vLLM workflows.

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install vllm
    ```

!!! warning "vLLM 0.22+ is not supported"
    OneComp's GPTQ serving relies on the Exllama GPTQ kernel for low bit-widths — 2-/3-bit, and 4-/8-bit when the model is asymmetric or uses activation reordering (`desc_act`). vLLM 0.22.0 removed the legacy Exllama GPTQ kernel, so these configurations fail at runtime. `pyproject.toml` therefore pins `vllm>=0.10,<0.22`; use a vLLM version below 0.22.

!!! note
    vLLM requires CUDA and a compatible GPU. See the [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/) for detailed installation instructions and system requirements.

!!! tip "macOS users"
    vLLM is not available on macOS. Quantize on Mac with `device="mps"`, then run
    inference locally via `load_quantized_model()` and Transformers `generate()`.
    See the [macOS / MPS guide](mps.md#inference-with-transformers).

!!! warning
    **uv users:** Do not install vLLM with `uv pip install vllm`. Packages installed via `uv pip` are not tracked by the lockfile and will be removed by subsequent `uv sync` or `uv run` commands. Always use `--extra vllm` instead.

## AutoBit + vLLM

When using `AutoBitQuantizer` with mixed-precision candidates (different `wbits` or `groupsize`),
the `enable_fused_groups` parameter must be `True` (the default since v0.5.1) to ensure vLLM compatibility.

vLLM fuses certain layers into a single linear module during inference:

- **qkv_proj**: `q_proj` + `k_proj` + `v_proj`
- **gate_up_proj**: `gate_proj` + `up_proj`

A fused module can only have **one** quantization configuration (one bit-width, one group size).
When `enable_fused_groups=True`, the ILP solver constrains fused-layer constituents to share the same quantizer.

!!! warning "`enable_fused_groups=False` causes vLLM load failures"
    Setting `enable_fused_groups=False` allows the ILP to assign different quantizers
    (different bits or group sizes) to layers within a fused group. The resulting model
    will **fail to load in vLLM** with an error like:
    *"Detected some but not all shards of ... are quantized. All shards of fused layers to have the same precision."*

    Only set `enable_fused_groups=False` if you do **not** intend to serve the model with vLLM.

`Runner.auto_run()` always sets `enable_fused_groups=True`, so models quantized via `auto_run` or the CLI are always vLLM-compatible.

## GPTQ MoE + vLLM

This section covers models saved with `quant_method="mixed_gptq"` (OneComp Mixed-GPTQ
plugin). vLLM's GPTQ `FusedMoE` kernel (`MoeWNA16Method`) dispatches **one** kernel
instance per MoE layer, so every expert in that layer must share the same GPTQ scheme
(bits, method, group size) — a mix within one layer is not representable.

`_lookup_moe_config()` enforces this at model-load time: it aggregates each expert's
config from `quantization_config`'s `quantization_bits`, and raises `ValueError` if the
layer's experts disagree on bits/group size, or if some experts were left unquantized
while others weren't.

!!! warning "Partially- or inconsistently-quantized MoE layers fail to load in vLLM"
    If a MoE layer has experts quantized with different `wbits`/`groupsize`, or only
    some of its experts were quantized at all, vLLM raises `ValueError` while building
    the model. This is the reason `run_quantize_with_qep_arch()` RTN-quantizes experts
    that receive zero calibration tokens via `_rtn_fallback_result()` rather than
    skipping them: an unquantized expert would otherwise leave its MoE layer partially
    quantized and unservable.

Quantizing MoE models with uniform `GPTQ` settings (no `module_wbits` overrides that
single out individual experts) keeps every layer's experts consistent.

## Usage

### 1. Quantize and save a model with OneComp

```python
from onecomp import Runner, ModelConfig
from onecomp.quantizer.gptq import GPTQ

model_config = ModelConfig(model_id="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct")
quantizer = GPTQ(wbits=4, groupsize=128)
runner = Runner(model_config=model_config, quantizer=quantizer, qep=True)
runner.run()
runner.save_quantized_model("./Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-gptq-4bit")
```

!!! note "Qwen3.6 save format"
    Qwen3.6 checkpoints should be saved with
    `save_quantized_model(..., save_format="full_wrapper")` before downstream
    inference or serving. See [Basic Usage](basic-usage.md#step-5-save-the-model)
    for the general save/load guidance.

    For MoE variants (e.g. Qwen3.6-A3B), `full_wrapper` also drops each expert's
    trivial `g_idx` buffer, since vLLM's GPTQ `FusedMoE` kernel has no `g_idx`
    parameter and an unmapped one would crash weight loading -- see the `desc_act`/
    `actorder` warning above for when this isn't safe to drop.

### 2. Serve with vLLM

There are two ways to use the quantized model with vLLM.

#### Option A: API Server (`vllm serve`)

Launch an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server:

```bash
vllm serve ./Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-gptq-4bit
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:8000` by default. You can send requests using `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "./Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-gptq-4bit",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is post-training quantization?"}],
    "max_tokens": 128
  }'
```

Or use the OpenAI Python client:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="dummy")
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="./Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-gptq-4bit",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is post-training quantization?"}],
    max_tokens=128,
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

#### Option B: Offline Inference (`vllm.LLM`)

For batch inference without launching a server:

```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

model_path = "./Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-gptq-4bit"

llm = LLM(
    model=model_path,
    max_model_len=2048,
    dtype="float16",
    enforce_eager=True,
)

outputs = llm.generate(
    ["What is post-training quantization?"],
    SamplingParams(max_tokens=128, temperature=0.0),
)
print(outputs[0].outputs[0].text)
```

!!! tip
    You do not need to pass `quantization=` explicitly. vLLM reads the `quant_method` from the model's `config.json` and automatically selects the correct plugin (vLLM's built-in GPTQ plugin for `gptq`, or the OneComp plugin for `mixed_gptq` / `dbf`).

!!! warning
    When combining quantization and vLLM inference in a single script, you **must** wrap your code in `if __name__ == "__main__":`. vLLM spawns worker processes that re-import the script, so without this guard the quantization step will run again in each child process.

Complete working examples (quantization + vLLM inference) are available:

- GPTQ: [`example/vllm_inference/example_gptq_vllm_inference.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/vllm_inference/example_gptq_vllm_inference.py)
- GPTQ (Qwen3.6 full-wrapper save): [`example/vllm_inference/example_gptq_vllm_qwen36_inference.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/vllm_inference/example_gptq_vllm_qwen36_inference.py)
- JointQ: [`example/vllm_inference/example_jointq_vllm_inference.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/vllm_inference/example_jointq_vllm_inference.py)
- AutoBit (mixed-precision): [`example/vllm_inference/example_autobit_vllm_inference.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/vllm_inference/example_autobit_vllm_inference.py)
- DBF: [`example/vllm_inference/example_dbf_vllm_inference.py`](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/example/vllm_inference/example_dbf_vllm_inference.py)

`JointQ` and `RTN` follow exactly the same flow as the GPTQ example above —
substitute `JointQ(bits=4, group_size=128)` or `RTN(wbits=4, groupsize=128)` for the
quantizer (JointQ additionally requires `qep=False`).

### 3. Chat with Open WebUI (optional)

[Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) provides a ChatGPT-like browser interface.
Because vLLM exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, Open WebUI can connect to it directly.

#### 3-1. Start the vLLM server

```bash
vllm serve ./Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-gptq-4bit
```

Keep this terminal open. The server listens on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

#### 3-2. Launch Open WebUI

=== "Docker (recommended)"

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:8080 \
      --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
      --name open-webui \
      ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:latest
    ```

    `--add-host` allows the container to reach the vLLM server running on the host (required on Linux; macOS/Windows Docker Desktop resolves it automatically).

=== "pip"

    Open WebUI requires **Python 3.11 or 3.12** (3.13+ is not supported).
    To avoid dependency conflicts with OneComp/vLLM, create a separate virtual environment:

    ```bash
    # Create a dedicated venv (uv auto-downloads Python 3.12 if needed)
    uv venv ~/open-webui-env --python 3.12
    source ~/open-webui-env/bin/activate

    # Install and launch
    uv pip install open-webui
    open-webui serve --port 3000
    ```

    When done, run `deactivate` to leave the venv.
    To uninstall completely, remove the directory: `rm -rf ~/open-webui-env`.

!!! note
    The first launch takes several minutes while Open WebUI runs database migrations and downloads an embedding model (~80 MB). Subsequent launches start in seconds.

#### 3-3. Connect to vLLM

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
2. Create an admin account on first launch.
3. Go to **Admin Panel** → **Settings** → **Connections**.
4. Under **OpenAI API**, set the URL:

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | URL | `http://host.docker.internal:8000/v1` (Docker) or `http://localhost:8000/v1` (pip) |
    | API Key | `dummy` (any non-empty string) |

5. Click **Save**. The quantized model appears in the model selector.

#### 3-4. Start chatting

Select the model from the dropdown at the top of the chat screen and start a conversation.

!!! tip
    Open WebUI persists chat history, supports multiple conversations, and provides features like system prompt customization and temperature control out of the box.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ONECOMP_DBF_NAIVE_LINEAR` | `0` | Set to `1` to force the naive (non-GemLite) kernel for DBF inference. Useful for debugging or when GemLite is unavailable. |
| `TRITON_CACHE_AUTOTUNING` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable Triton's autotune disk-cache. Recommended when GemLite fails at inference time due to the Triton autotune disk-cache bug (see below). |

### GemLite Automatic Fallback

The DBF plugin automatically falls back to the naive linear kernel if GemLite fails during inference.
When this happens, a `WARNING` is logged:

```
WARNING [...] [DBF] GemLite inference path failed (ErrorType: detail).
Disabling GemLite and falling back to the naive linear path for the remainder of this run.
To run with GemLite, relaunch with TRITON_CACHE_AUTOTUNING=0 (works around the triton autotune disk-cache bug).
To skip GemLite from the start, set ONECOMP_DBF_NAIVE_LINEAR=1.
```

The fallback is **process-wide**: once GemLite fails on any layer, all subsequent layers use the naive path for the rest of the process lifetime.
Inference continues and produces correct output, but throughput may be lower than with GemLite.

If the WARNING appears, try the following in order:

1. **Set `TRITON_CACHE_AUTOTUNING=0`** — works around the Triton autotune disk-cache bug that is the most common cause of GemLite failures under vLLM:

    ```bash
    TRITON_CACHE_AUTOTUNING=0 vllm serve ./your-quantized-model
    # or
    TRITON_CACHE_AUTOTUNING=0 python your_vllm_script.py
    ```

2. **Set `ONECOMP_DBF_NAIVE_LINEAR=1`** — skips GemLite entirely from startup. Use this if the issue persists after step 1 or if you do not need GemLite performance:

    ```bash
    ONECOMP_DBF_NAIVE_LINEAR=1 vllm serve ./your-quantized-model
    ```

!!! note "Out-of-memory errors are not caught"
    `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` is re-raised immediately and does **not** trigger the fallback.
    The naive path requires more memory than GemLite, so falling back on OOM would make the situation worse rather than better.
    If you see an OOM error, reduce `--gpu-memory-utilization` or the model's context length.

## Troubleshooting

### `RuntimeError: DeepGEMM backend is not available or outdated`

vLLM unconditionally runs a DeepGEMM (FP8) kernel warmup at engine startup, even for non-FP8 quantization such as GPTQ, DBF, or Mixed-GPTQ. When the optional [`deep_gemm`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM) package is not installed, the warmup fails with:

```
RuntimeError: DeepGEMM backend is not available or outdated. Please install or update the `deep_gemm` to a newer version to enable FP8 kernels.
```

OneComp-quantized models do not require DeepGEMM. Disable the FP8 kernel path before launching vLLM:

```bash
export VLLM_USE_DEEP_GEMM=0
export VLLM_DEEP_GEMM_WARMUP=skip

# Then launch vllm as usual
vllm serve ./your-quantized-model
# or
python your_vllm_script.py
```

Both variables are read directly by vLLM; OneComp does not interpret them.


## GPT-OSS (mixed_gptq)

GPT-OSS (openai/gpt-oss-20b, openai/gpt-oss-120b) uses the mixed_gptq plugin but
requires **additional vLLM runtime patches** and 4-bit MoE experts quantized with
**`group_size=64`** (GPT-OSS `hidden_size` 2880 is not divisible by 128).

See the full guide: **[GPT-OSS](gptoss.md)** — covers quantization, HF save/load,
`apply_all` patches, and verification scripts.
## ROCm support (AMD GPUs)

GPTQ models can be served on AMD GPUs via ROCm using a dedicated opt-in venv and
the `onecomp-vllm-v0-24-0-rocm` patch package, not the main `--extra vllm` workflow.

!!! warning "Experimental / opt-in"
    ROCm is not part of `uv sync --extra vllm`. The main project pins `vllm<0.22`
    for CUDA (Exllama GPTQ compatibility); ROCm requires vLLM `0.24.0+rocm*`
    from the [AMD wheel index](https://wheels.vllm.ai/rocm/0.24.0/rocm723).

see [ROCm setup guide](https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/OneCompression/blob/main/envs/vllm/v0_24_0_rocm/README.md) for details.
