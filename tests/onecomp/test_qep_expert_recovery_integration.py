"""CPU-only integration test for MoE expert recovery + RTN fallback in

``run_quantize_with_qep_arch``.

A tiny hand-built model with a hard-routed top-1 MoE layer replaces a real
HF model + dataset download (see ``tests/onecomp/test_qep_gptq_regression.py``
for the GPU/network-gated equivalent using TinyLlama). Routing is pinned via
crafted embedding/router weights instead of a trained router.
